Good report overall. Below are some comments:
- It would be nice to have a comparison between Hugging Face and other serialization to show why they are especially well suited for sanitization.
- In Section 2.3, you say that "we find that only a select few methods ... are nessasary" How do you find this? Why is this analysis complete?
- What are possible paths for fixing the limitations that you describe?
- For the final presentation, you should have a demo of the work.
